# Other Coding Agents

Explore the landscape of AI coding assistants beyond Claude Code, understanding their strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases.

## GitHub Copilot

Microsoft's AI pair programmer, powered by OpenAI Codex.

### Key Features
- **Real-time suggestions** in your IDE
- **Context-aware completions** based on surrounding code
- **Multi-language support** with strong performance in popular languages
- **Comment-to-code generation** from natural language descriptions

### Strengths
- Excellent IDE integration (VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim)
- Fast, real-time suggestions
- Good at completing common patterns
- Learns from your coding style over time

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Type a comment and Copilot suggests implementation
// Function to calculate compound interest
function calculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time, frequency) {
  return principal * Math.pow(1 + rate / frequency, frequency * time);
}

// Copilot can also complete partial implementations
const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 }
];

// Type "const adults = users.filter(" and Copilot suggests:
const adults = users.filter(user => user.age >= 18);
```

### Best Use Cases
- Auto-completion while coding
- Boilerplate code generation
- Learning new APIs and frameworks
- Quick prototyping

### Limitations
- Can suggest outdated or insecure patterns
- Limited understanding of project-wide architecture
- May encourage copy-paste programming
- Requires manual review of all suggestions

## Cursor AI

AI-first code editor designed for AI-assisted development.

### Key Features
- **Native AI integration** built into the editor
- **Codebase understanding** across multiple files
- **AI-powered refactoring** with context awareness
- **Natural language editing** through chat interface

### Strengths
- Deep integration with AI capabilities
- Understands project structure and dependencies
- Excellent for large-scale refactoring
- Chat-based interaction for complex requests

### Example Usage
```typescript
// Ask Cursor to refactor across multiple files
// Chat: "Convert this class component to hooks and move state to Redux"

// Before (UserProfile.tsx)
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  state = { loading: true, user: null };
  
  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchUser();
  }
  // ... rest of component
}

// After - Cursor automatically:
// 1. Converts to functional component
// 2. Creates Redux slice
// 3. Updates imports across files
// 4. Maintains type safety
```

### Best Use Cases
- Large codebase navigation and understanding
- Complex refactoring operations
- AI-guided architecture decisions
- Learning unfamiliar codebases

### Limitations
- Newer tool with smaller community
- Can be resource-intensive
- Learning curve for AI-first workflows
- May not integrate with existing toolchains

## Codeium

Free AI coding assistant with focus on privacy and speed.

### Key Features
- **Free unlimited usage** for individuals
- **Privacy-focused** with on-premise options
- **Fast completions** with minimal latency
- **Wide language support** including niche languages

### Strengths
- Completely free for individual developers
- Strong privacy controls
- Fast performance
- Good support for less common languages

### Example Usage
```python
# Codeium excels at completing repetitive patterns
def process_user_data(users):
    result = []
    for user in users:
        # Codeium suggests common data processing patterns
        if user.is_active and user.email_verified:
            processed_user = {
                'id': user.id,
                'name': user.full_name,
                'email': user.email,
                'created_at': user.created_at.isoformat()
            }
            result.append(processed_user)
    return result
```

### Best Use Cases
- Budget-conscious development
- Privacy-sensitive projects
- Learning and educational use
- Supporting less common programming languages

### Limitations
- Fewer advanced features compared to paid alternatives
- Smaller training dataset
- Limited integration options
- Less sophisticated context understanding
