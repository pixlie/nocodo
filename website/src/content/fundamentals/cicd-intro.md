# CI/CD Introduction

Learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment - essential practices for modern software development.

## What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes as they are committed to version control.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** extends CI by automatically deploying tested code changes to production or staging environments.

## Benefits

- **Early Bug Detection** - Issues are caught quickly
- **Faster Delivery** - Automated processes reduce manual work
- **Consistent Deployments** - Standardized deployment process
- **Reduced Risk** - Smaller, frequent changes are easier to debug

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

### 1. Source Control
- Code changes trigger the pipeline
- Usually integrated with Git repositories

### 2. Build
- Compile code and dependencies
- Create deployable artifacts

### 3. Test
- Run automated tests (unit, integration, e2e)
- Code quality checks and linting

### 4. Deploy
- Deploy to staging/production environments
- Run post-deployment tests

## Popular CI/CD Tools

- **GitHub Actions** - Integrated with GitHub repositories
- **GitLab CI** - Built into GitLab platform
- **Jenkins** - Open-source automation server
- **CircleCI** - Cloud-based CI/CD platform

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep pipelines fast** - Optimize build and test times
2. **Fail fast** - Stop the pipeline on first failure
3. **Test everything** - Don't deploy untested code
4. **Monitor deployments** - Watch for issues after deployment

## Getting Started

1. Start with a simple CI pipeline
2. Add automated tests
3. Gradually introduce deployment automation
4. Monitor and improve pipeline performance
