# Code Quality & Review

Learn essential practices for maintaining high code quality through reviews, automated tools, and documentation.

## Code Review Process

Code reviews are systematic examinations of code changes before they're merged into the main branch.

### Benefits
- **Bug prevention** - Catch issues before production
- **Knowledge sharing** - Team learns from each other
- **Code consistency** - Maintain style and standards
- **Mentoring** - Help junior developers improve

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Does the code solve the intended problem?
- [ ] Is the code readable and well-documented?
- [ ] Are there any obvious bugs or edge cases?
- [ ] Does it follow team coding standards?
- [ ] Are tests included and comprehensive?
- [ ] Is the performance acceptable?

## Linting and Formatting

Automated tools that enforce code style and catch common issues.

### ESLint (JavaScript/TypeScript)
```json
{
  "extends": ["@typescript-eslint/recommended"],
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "prefer-const": "error",
    "no-console": "warn"
  }
}
```

### Prettier (Code Formatting)
```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80
}
```

### Benefits
- **Consistency** - Same style across the codebase
- **Automation** - No manual style discussions
- **Error prevention** - Catch syntax errors early

## Documentation Standards

Good documentation makes code maintainable and helps team collaboration.

### Code Comments
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax
 * @param {number} subtotal - The base price before tax
 * @param {number} taxRate - Tax rate as decimal (0.08 for 8%)
 * @returns {number} Total price including tax
 */
function calculateTotal(subtotal, taxRate) {
  return subtotal * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

### README Structure

```

## Refactoring Techniques

Improving code structure without changing functionality.

### Common Refactoring Patterns
- **Extract Function** - Break large functions into smaller ones
- **Rename Variables** - Use descriptive names
- **Remove Duplication** - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **Simplify Conditionals** - Reduce nested if statements

### Example Refactoring
```javascript
// Before
function processUser(user) {
  if (user.age >= 18 && user.verified && user.active) {
    // complex logic here
  }
}

// After
function canUserAccessFeature(user) {
  return user.age >= 18 && user.verified && user.active;
}

function processUser(user) {
  if (canUserAccessFeature(user)) {
    // complex logic here
  }
}
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage
Percentage of code covered by tests
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Code Complexity
Cyclomatic complexity measures code paths
- Low complexity (1-10): Easy to test and maintain
- Medium complexity (11-20): More complex but manageable
- High complexity (21+): Consider refactoring

### Technical Debt
Accumulated shortcuts and suboptimal solutions
- Track debt in code comments or issues
- Regularly schedule refactoring time
- Address debt before it becomes unmanageable

## Tools and Setup

### Pre-commit Hooks
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,ts}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
- name: Lint code
  run: npm run lint

- name: Check formatting
  run: npm run format:check

- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage
```

## Best Practices

1. **Automate what you can** - Use tools for consistency
2. **Review everything** - No code goes to production unreviewed
3. **Keep it simple** - Prefer readable code over clever code
4. **Document decisions** - Explain why, not just what
5. **Refactor regularly** - Don't let technical debt accumulate
