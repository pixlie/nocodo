# Git Basics

Learn the fundamental concepts of version control with Git - the foundation of modern software development.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.

## Key Concepts

### Repository
A Git repository is a directory that contains your project files and the complete history of changes.

### Commits
A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and a message describing the changes.

### Branches
Branches allow you to work on different features or experiments in isolation from the main codebase.

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Check status of files
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add <filename>
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write meaningful commit messages** - Describe what and why, not how
2. **Commit frequently** - Small, focused commits are easier to understand
3. **Use branches** - Keep your main branch stable
4. **Review before committing** - Use `git status` and `git diff` to check changes

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with basic Git operations, explore:
- Branching and merging strategies
- Collaborative workflows (GitFlow, GitHub Flow)
- Advanced Git commands and techniques
